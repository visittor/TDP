\section{Future Work}
	\subsection{Localization}
		Localization is important process in humanoid soccer. Robot cannot make decision correctly without knowing where it is. Hence, our goal of development for the next 6 months is to make localization system available for our robots. Object detection such as field boundary detection, lines detection and a new concept about landmark detection will be combined which will allow us to be closer to our goal of vision based localization.
		
		\paragraph{}
		Particle filter is one of interesting algorithm for localization in humanoid soccer robot since map of a field is known before hand. Our information from line detection will probably enough for this algorithm. A problem that we expect is symmetry of field which can cause robot to be confused about it heading direction. This problem will probably be handled by giving a robot an initial state or landmark detection if it's proven to be suitable for our problem.
