Institute of Field Robotics(FIBO) at King Mongkut's University of Technology Thonburi (KMUTT) has developed the humanoid robots to participate in RoboCup humanoid kid-sized league since 2005 under the name 'Team KMUTT' and later on 'Pheonix'. The successor, 'Hanuman-FC', won the Thailand Humanoid Soccer Robot Championship 2012 and participated in World-RoboCup 2013 (Eindhoven, Netherlands) under the name 'Hanuman-KMUTT'.
